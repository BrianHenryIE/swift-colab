# Syntax Coloring

Swift-Colab works with any Jupyter notebook, but Swift ones are better. All code samples in docs aim to use Swift syntax coloring, even if in another language

## Swift

Comes from Monaco editor (link)

## Shell

Use parentheses when dealing with strings or numbers that are arguments, use parentheses liberally

## Python

This may be easier on the eyes:

```swift
#/*
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount(...)
#*/
```

vs

```swift
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount(...)
```
